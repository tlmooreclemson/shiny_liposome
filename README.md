# Shiny Liposome

This is an R Shiny app that uses the results from both an artificial neural network and a support-vector machines model to predict liposome size (i.e. hydrodynamic diameter) and dispersity/stability, respectively, from microfluidic-synthesized liposomes. The underlying database was built on liposomes formulated via a tabletop NanoAssemblr instrument and reports parameters such as total flow rate (ml/min), aqueous:organic ratio, and the total initial lipid concentration in the organic phase.
